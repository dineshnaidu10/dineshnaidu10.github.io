## **Key Projects**
---
>### Crime Incident Mapping and Crime Rate Prediction Model using Machine Learning Tools
>- Master's Degree Thesis Project
>- Extract, transform, and load crime incident, population, population density, inflation rates, unemployment rates, deprivation scores data in England
>- Development of a crime incident mapping dashboard using Microsoft Power BI
>- Development of crime rate prediction models using Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression for England from 2011 to 2022
>- The crime incident mapping dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive interface for exploring crime patterns and trends across regions and time periods
>- Leverages Microsoft Power BI's capabilities to visualize crime data on maps and identify crime hotspots and areas of concern
>- Both Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression models achieved similar results in crime rate prediction, with an R-squared value of 0.85 and a Mean Absolute Error of approximately 2.8
>- Crime-related factors, living conditions, and socio-economic indicators as the most influential predictors of crime rate


>### EY - Open Science Data Challenge 2023 - Level 1
>- Global Semi-Finalist in the competition
>- Predict the presence or non-presence of rice crops at a given coordinate location (An Giang province in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam).
>- Utilize satellite data from Microsoft Planetary Computer via API. Primarily used MODIS and Sentinel-1-RTC satellite data
>- Use vegetation indices (VI) such as NDVI, EVI, DVI, SAVI, STVI, LAI and RVI for analyzing the greenness of vegetation
>- Additional statistical measures (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, range) computed for select VI 
>- Apart from VI, latent heat flux (LE), total of evapotranspiration (ET), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) data were also used
>- Total number of features for a year is 239 features. Used data from 2020 and 2021, resulting in 478 features for training the ML model. Using multiple year data will help the model into taking account of different rice crop growth cycles in a year
>- Bounding box buffer used for each coordinate 0.0005
>- Experimented with different ML models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
>- Chose RF as the most accurate model, with ANN being close behind
>- Final model built using RF classifier with GridSearchCV. Managed to achieve 100% accuracy on the validation dataset

The following article is a part of my Big Data Management RDBMS Project written in SQL and executed in MySQL. Requirements of the project included finding a relatively large dataset and performing data analysis queries on it.

## Data Collection
The datasets of Amazon Prime are obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/amazon-prime-tv-shows-and-movies?resource=download) where it contains two .CSV files which are the titles and credits. The title consists of 15 columns and 9000+ rows including the column name such as movie_id, title, type, descriptions, release_year, age_certification, runtime, genres, production_countries, seasons, imdb_id, imdb_score, imdb_votes, tmdb_popularity and tmdb_score. The credits file consists of 5 columns and 120k+ rows with columns person_id, movie_id, person_name, character_name and roles. Since the columns release_year, age_certification, runtime, seasons, imdb_score, imdb_votes, tmdb_popularity and tmdb_score are numeric in nature, it is possible to derive statistical metrics from the dataset. Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows the snippets of the titles and credits file.

In order to avoid a cluttered dataset, the 2 CSV files from Figure 1 and Figure 2 are further split up resulting in a total of 6 CSV files which will form the basis of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) used in this project. The breakdown of the resulting 6 CSV files is as below,

- The first file is named “titles”. In it contains only the “title_id” and “title”. This file is derived from the first and second column of the parent file “titles” (Figure 1). A duplication check is also performed on the first column to ensure non-repeating id. The resultant file is made up of 9867 rows and 2 columns. The snippet of “titles” file is depicted in Figure 3.

![Figure 3](/Database/Picture3.png)
_**Figure 3:** Snippet of "titles" file_

- The second file is named “titles_info” and like the name suggests, it only displays key information on the title. This file is derived from the columns “id”, “type”, “description”, “release_year”, “age_certification”, “runtime”, “genres”, “production_countries” and “seasons” of the parent file “titles” (Figure 1). The resultant file consists of 9867 rows and 9 columns. The snippet of “titles_info” file is illustrated in Figure 4.

![Figure 4](/Database/Picture4.png)
_**Figure 4:** Snippet of "titles_info" file_

- The third file is named “imdb_rating” where this file only contains imdb rating information and is linked through other files by “title_id”. This file is derived from the columns “id”, “imdb_id”, “imdb_score” and “imdb_votes” from the parent file “titles” (Figure 1). This results in a total of 9867 rows and 4 columns. The snippet of “imdb_ratings” file is depicted in Figure 5.

![Figure 5](/Database/Picture5.png)
_**Figure 5:** Snippet of "imdb_rating" file_

- The fourth file is named “tmdb_rating” which contains information on tmdb ratings and linked through other files by “title_id”. This file is derived from the columns “id”, “tmdb_popularity” and “tmdb_score” from the parent file “titles” (Figure 1). This file consists of 9870 rows and 3 columns. The snippet of “tmdb_rating” file is illustrated in Figure 6.

![Figure 6](/Database/Picture6.png)
_**Figure 6:** Snippet of "tmdb_rating" file_

- The fifth file is named “actors” which has the names of actors and is linked through other files by “actor_id”. This file is derived from the columns “person_id” and “name” from the parent file “credits” (Figure 2). This file is made up of 80508 rows and 2 columns. The snippet of “actors” is depicted in Figure 7.

![Figure 7](/Database/Picture7.png)
_**Figure 7:** Snippet of "actors" file_

- The sixth and final file is named “acting_credits” which has the information of characters and the roles they play, while being linked to other files through “actor_id” and “titles_id”. This file is derived from the columns “person_id”, “id”, “character” and “role” from the parent file “credits” (Figure 2). This file consists 124234 rows and 4 columns. The snippet of “acting_credits” is depicted in Figure 8.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD for this project is illustrated in Figure 9 with the Primary Key (PK), Foreign Key (FK) and their respective Cardinality (Crow’s Foot Notation) according to the legends respectively.

![Figure 9](/Database/Picture9.png)
_**Figure 9:** The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)_

The entities from Figure 9 are described as below,

**(a) actors**
: In this entity, there are two attributes which are actor_id (PK) and name. This entity has a cardinality of one-to-many (1:N) with the entity **acting_credits**. This means that each actor can have many acting credits, but each acting credit can only be linked to one actor.

**(b) acting_credits**
: In this entity, there are five attributes which are acredits_id (PK), actor_id (FK referenced from entity **actors**), titles_id (FK referenced from entity **titles**), character_name and role_name. This entity has a cardinality of one-to-many (1:N) with the entity **titles**. This means that each title can have many acting credits, but each acting credit can only be linked to one title. Other than that, this entity also has a one-to-many (1:N) cardinality with the entity **actors**, meaning that each actor can have many acting credits, but each acting credit can only be linked to one actor.

**(c) titles**
: In this entity, there are two attributes which are titles_id (PK) and title. This entity has a cardinality of one-to-many (1:N) with the entity **acting_credits**. This means that each title can have many acting credits, but each acting credit can only be linked to one title. Apart from that, this entity also has a cardinality of one-to-one (1:1) with the entity **titles_info** meaning that each title can only have one title info and each title info can only belong to one title. Other than that, this entity also has a cardinality of one-to-one (1:1) with the entity **tmdb_rating**. This means that each title can have only one tmdb rating and each tmdb rating belongs to only one title. Lastly, this entity has a cardinality of one-to-one (1:1) with the entity **imdb_rating**. This means that each title can have only one imdb rating and each imdb rating belongs to only one title.

**(d) titles_info**
: In this entity, there are ten attributes which are titles_info_id (PK), titles_id (FK referenced from entity **titles**), type_name, descr, release_year, age_certification, runtime, genres, production_countries and seasons. This entity has a cardinality of one-to-one (1:1) with the entity **titles** meaning that each title can only have one title info and each title info can only belong to one title.

**(e) tmdb_rating**
: In this entity, there are four attributes which are tmdb_id (PK), titles_id (FK referenced from entity **titles**), tmdb_popularity and tmdb_score. This entity has a cardinality of one-to-one (1:1) with the entity **titles**. This means that each title can have only one tmdb rating and each tmdb rating belongs to only one title.

**(f) imdb_rating**
: In this entity, there are five attributes which are imdb_rating_id (PK), titles_id (FK referenced from entity **titles**), imdb_id, imdb_score and imdb_votes. This entity has a cardinality of one-to-one (1:1) with the entity **titles**. This means that each title can have only one imdb rating and each imdb rating belongs to only one title.

);
```

For the purposes of importing the data for each individual entity, it is possible to manually upload each entity's data using MySQL Workbench. However, I found this process to be extremely time consuming and resorted to bulk transfer the data using a custom Python script instead (which saved me several hours). The aforementioned Python script is as below,

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import csv
import sys
import MySQLdb

conn = MySQLdb.connect(host="127.0.0.1", user="username", password="password", 
database="amazon_prime")

cursor = conn.cursor()
csv_data = csv.reader(open('acting_credits.csv'))
header = next(csv_data)

print('Importing the CSV Files')
for row in tqdm(csv_data):
    #print(row)
    cursor.execute(
        "INSERT INTO acting_credits (actor_id, titles_id, character_name, role_name) \
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)", row)
   
conn.commit()
cursor.close()
print('Done')
```

The following article details the process on collecting crime rate data in England from 2011-2022 in a single tabular file. The pre-requisites for this project include the [Crime Incident](/posts/DS-4) and [Population](/posts/DS-7) data which can be accessed via my previous posts in this site.

The basic idea of deriving crime rates from crime incident data are outlined in the steps below,
>1.	Loading the crime incident data in a Pandas DataFrame
>2.	Adding a ‘Count’ column with a value of 1 for all rows to label each incident as 1 count of crime incident.
>3.	Saving the DataFrame in a new DataFrame with only columns of Month, LSOA code and Count.
>4.	Perform a Pandas groupby method to derive the total crime counts by month and LSOA code.
>5.	Loading the population data in a Pandas DataFrame.
>6.	Merge the DataFrames from step 4 and step 5 using Month and LSOA code as the joining key.
>7.	As in previous research, the average population of each LSOA is 1500 and adapting that number into the general crime rate formula gives us, Crime Rate =  crime/population  × 1500
>8.	A new column ‘Crime Rate’ is created by applying the formula in step 7 on each row.

The snippet of the crime rate data is shown in Figure 1 below.
